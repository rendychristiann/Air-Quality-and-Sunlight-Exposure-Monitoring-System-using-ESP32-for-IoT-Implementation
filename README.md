# Air-Quality-and-Sunlight-Exposure-Monitoring-System
<b> Smart IoT Webserver Based for Air Quality and Sunlight Exposure Monitoring System for Agriculture Monitoring using ESP32 </b>

This project uses the ESP32 and two sensors, including the DHT11 sensor and the photodiode sensor, to monitor air quality, such as temperature and humidity, as well as the quality of sunlight exposure needed by plants to grow and develop optimally.
